# Shamir Secret Sharing

This is an assignment for my uni. I decided to use Rust because I'd been wanting to try and learn it for a while and this was a very good excuse to get started.

My end goal with this project is for it hopefully being good enough to be used as a library by our fellow Rustaceans.
